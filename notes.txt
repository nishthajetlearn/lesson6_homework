Explanation of the Code
Data Loading: The Titanic dataset is loaded using pandas.
Data Analysis:
We count the number of passengers by gender using value_counts().
We calculate the average fare by gender using groupby().
We count the number of passengers in each class using value_counts().
Plotting:
A bar graph is created for the total number of men and women.
Another bar graph is plotted for the average fare of men and women.
A pie chart is created to visualize the distribution of passengers across different classes.
